Welcome to the Rails Performance Workshop

<% if @keys.size > 1 %>
Your license keys are:
<% else %>
Your license key is:
<% end %>

<% @keys.each do |key| %>
  <%= key.key %>
<% end %>

To get started, open up your terminal and:

$ gem install rpw && rpw start

... to get going.

If you the person who will be taking the workshop is not the same as the purchaser,
(i.e. you bought multiple keys OR the purchase email is not the email you want to get invited to Slack),
be sure to get your Slack invite by changing the email registered with your key.
You may only do this once:

$ rpw key register YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS
